## About typst

`typst` does not support code execution output in posters. To include code
execution output in your poster, the suggested walk-around is:

1. Render a separate HTML file and save the output as a PNG image.
2. Include image, e.f., output.png, in the poster using the Quarto command

    `![title](output.png){#fig-label width="100%" fig-align="center"}`
